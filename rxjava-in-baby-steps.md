##Title
RxJava in Baby Steps

##Abstract
Reactive Programming with RxJava has widely been adopted by both backend services and Android applications alike. Yet, the steep learning curve leaves many developers hesitant about adding it to their own Software tool belt. I was one such developer. Over the past two years, I’ve watched countless videos, read numerous blog posts and attended several conference talks on the subject. Yet, I often left each experience feeling only slightly more knowledgeable, but not quite empowered to start using RxJava in my apps. That’s not going to happen in this talk!

We cover the bare minimum concepts you need to grok, in order to start using RxJava today. In particular, we focus on:

* The 3 O’s: Observable, Observer and Operator
* The most common Operators: map(), flatMap(), and filter()
* Understanding those Marble Diagrams
* How Kotlin helps to simplify the code

Reactive Programming is not going away any time soon. It’s a powerful way to create asynchronous, event-based applications. It allows developers the ability to craft applications that can easily combine multiple network calls, gracefully handle failures, all while providing a snappy user experience. I want everyone to feel comfortable with the basic concepts of RxJava. Today can be your first step…
