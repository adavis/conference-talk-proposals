##Title
From Grails to Android

##Abstract
One of the key new features of Grails 3 is the build system now being a set of plugins for the Gradle build tool. The Android Framework also uses the Gradle build system to build, test, run and package applications. In this talk, learn how to move from developing applications for Grails 3 to Android. Weâ€™re going to cover the following:

* Project Structure Similarities
* Use of Gradle Commands
* User Interface: GSP Pages vs. Android Layout XML Files
* Dependency Injection: Spring vs. Dagger 2
* Review a Simple Android Application

Walk away with the foundation you need to tackle your first Android application!
